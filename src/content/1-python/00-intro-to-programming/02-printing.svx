## Introduction to Printing in Python

Printing is one of the most basic and essential functions in programming. In Python, the `print()` function is used to display output to the screen. This lesson will cover the basics of using the `print()` function, formatting output, and some advanced printing techniques.

### The `print()` Function

The `print()` function in Python is used to output text or variables to the console. It's a great way to see the results of your code or to debug programs. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
When you run this code, it will display:

`Hello, World!`

### Practical Examples

Below are a few examples of more ways to use the print statement.

```python
print("Name\tAge")
print("Luna\t17")
print("Alex\t18")
```
This will output:

```
Name    Age
Luna    17
Alex    18
```
